     * PART 3 - Code Scanning and Interpretation
     *      * Look at the getHiddenSecrets method and identify the following parts:
     *
     * What is the access modifier: (public, private, protected)?
     * // The access modifier is public. --> "public" class HiddenSecrets
     *
     * Is it a Class method or an object Instance method, how do you know?
     * // The method is a Class method. --> public "class" HiddenSecrets
     *
     * What is its return data-type?
     * // There return data type is Void. --> public static "void" getHiddenSecrets(File file)
     *
     * Does it require any parameters, and if so, how many and of what type?
     * // Void returns no value. The variable File is the return value for public static void getHiddenSecrets(File file)
     *
     *      *Scan line by line through the code and try to determine how it works?
     * What is familiar to you?
     * // public, class, import, new, if, err, catch, metadata
     *
     * What is not familiar to you?
     * // for
     *
     * Do the for loops make sense, and if so, tell me what you think they do?
     * //I understand it better with the error and catch as context that the for statements looks at the condition and returns either true or false. This is chapter 7.2
